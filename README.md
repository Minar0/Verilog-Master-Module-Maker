This is my Master Module Maker for System Verilog. It's a GUI program written in python that lets you visually stitch modules together in order to form a module made purely of other modules. I made it in like, two days, with help from Claude.ai so expect it to be pretty jank. The actual parsing is done by a few nasty regex patterns that I had not the strength to write myself so I had an AI do it for me. I hope this does not make me a vibe coder.

Anyways, make sure you have PyQt5 installed with pip install PyQt5. It's how I did the GUI. From there, just run the MMMmain.py script.

Seriously though, don't use this unless you have no other options. It's just a bandaid fix to a very specific problem I was having





I really should have just bitten the bullet and wrote this in C++. This is beyond what Python should be used for. Feel free to judge me for my poor decisions.
